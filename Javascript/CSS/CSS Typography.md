Remember that fonts with spaces in the name must be wrapped in quotes for CSS.

# font-weight

The **`font-weight`** [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the [`font-family`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family) that is currently set.

## Universal selector

The universal selector * **selects all HTML elements on the page**.

# letter-spacing

The **`letter-spacing`** [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the horizontal spacing behavior between text characters. This value is added to the natural spacing between characters while rendering the text. Positive values of `letter-spacing` causes characters to spread farther apart, while negative values of `letter-spacing` bring characters closer together.

The `letter-spacing` property can be used to adjust the space between each character of text in an element.

# :not()
The :not() CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items from being selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.
The `:not` pseudo-selector can be used to select all elements that do not match the given CSS rule.
Exemple:

div:not(#example) {
  color: red;
}

# text-indent

The **`text-indent`** CSS property sets the length of empty space (indentation) that is put before lines of text in a block.

Exemple: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-indent

# <span>: The Content Span element

The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element.

# <i>: The Idiomatic Text element

The **`<i>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the `<i>` naming of this element.
